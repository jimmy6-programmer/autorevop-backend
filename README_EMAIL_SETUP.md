## üîß Step-by-Step Email Setup

### Step 1: Choose Your Email Service

#### Option A: Gmail (Easiest for Development)
1. **Create a Gmail Account** for your business
2. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on the account
3. **Generate an App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification ‚Üí App passwords
   - Generate password for "Mail"
   - Use this password (not your regular password)

#### Option B: Outlook/Hotmail (Alternative)
1. Create an Outlook account
2. Use your regular password (no app password needed)

#### Option C: Professional Email Services (Recommended for Production)

**SendGrid (Most Popular)**:
1. Sign up at [sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com)
2. Create an API key
3. Use these settings:
   ```
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_USER=apikey
   EMAIL_PASS=your-sendgrid-api-key
   ```

**Mailgun (Good Alternative)**:
1. Sign up at [mailgun.com](https://mailgun.com)
2. Verify your domain
3. Get SMTP credentials

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. **Copy the example file**:
   ```bash
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   ```

2. **Edit the .env file** with your email settings:
   ```env
   # For Gmail
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_SECURE=false
   EMAIL_USER=autorevop.business@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password-here

   # For Outlook
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp-mail.outlook.com
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_USER=autorevop@outlook.com

   # For SendGrid
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_USER=apikey
   EMAIL_PASS=SG.your-sendgrid-api-key
   ```

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test email sending**:
   - Try user registration
   - Check server logs for email sending confirmation
   - Verify emails are received

### Step 4: Production Considerations

#### Security Best Practices:
- ‚úÖ Use environment variables (never hardcode credentials)
